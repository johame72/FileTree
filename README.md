# 🌳 FileTree PowerShell Script

## 📖 Overview

The `FileTree.ps1` is a PowerShell script designed specifically for Windows 11 that provides a visual representation of the directory structure. It displays both directories 📂 and files 📄 in a tree-like 🌳 format, making it easier to understand the layout of your project.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- 🪟 Windows 11
- 🖥 PowerShell 5.1 or higher

## ✨ Features

- 🌳 Generates a tree-like view of directories and files
- 📄 Helps you quickly understand the hierarchy of your project
- 🏁 Simple to set up and use

## 🚀 How to Use

### 🏁 Initial Setup

1. 💾 Save `FileTree.ps1` in a directory of your choice.

### 🏃‍♂️ Running the Script

1. 💻 Open the Windows PowerShell terminal.

2. 📂 Navigate to the directory you want to visualize.

3. 🎬 Run `.\FileTree.ps1`.

The script will display the directory structure in the terminal in a tree-like format, just like the example provided above.

👩‍💻 To make `FileTree.ps1` easily accessible from any directory, you have several options:

### 🛠 Option 1: Add Script Directory to the PATH

1. **📁 Move Script**: Move `FileTree.ps1` to a directory that is easy to remember and access. For example, you could create a `Scripts` folder in your user directory or your `C:\` drive.

2. **🌐 Add to PATH**: Add that directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

3. **🔄 Open a New PowerShell Session**: After this, you can call `FileTree.ps1` from any directory.

   - ❗ Note: Incorrectly modifying the `PATH` variable can lead to issues. Make sure you know what you're doing before modifying it.

### 🛠 Option 2: Create a PowerShell Alias

1. **📝 Open Your PowerShell Profile**: Enter `notepad $PROFILE` in a PowerShell window. This will open your PowerShell profile in Notepad. You'll be prompted to create one if the profile doesn't exist.

2. **👍 Add Alias**: Add the following line to your PowerShell profile, replacing `C:\path\to\FileTree.ps1` with the full path to your script:

   ```powershell
   Set-Alias filetree "C:\path\to\FileTree.ps1"
   ```

3. **💾 Save and Close Notepad**: Save the changes and close Notepad.

4. **🔄 Reload Profile or Restart PowerShell**: For the changes to take effect, either reload your profile with `. $PROFILE` or close and reopen PowerShell.

After doing this, you should be able to use the command `filetree` in PowerShell, no matter your current directory, to run your `FileTree.ps1` script.

### 🛠 Option 3: Use a Fully Qualified Path

- 📍 This doesn't allow you to run it from "anywhere," but you can always run the script using its fully qualified path:

  ```powershell
  & "C:\path\to\FileTree.ps1"
  ```

Any of these methods will allow you to execute the script from any directory, making it easier to visualize your directory structure. Choose the one that best suits your needs 🌟.
